## 10/17/2025 1 PM - Drawing Rought Sketches   

I started brainstroming ideas and sketched out some ideas of how everything can be positioned. I had to think about overall size as I want to keep it kinda small. Next I am going to look of some of the parts and start sketching it in Onshape. I also need to see if a motor can power a mini shreder. I also need to run 2 stepper motors one from extruder and spooler. I am thinking of using the RAMPS 1.4 board. I looked into all the power requierments but I need to find a good power supply![PXL_20251017_203021542.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjc0NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fbde216a4efbf2e1c35edbb74509fa38e3c6f60b/PXL_20251017_203021542.jpg)
  

## 10/17/2025 5 PM - Researched Parts & Created a List  

I did a lot of research looking to see if anyone had already done something like this before or any parts or components I can find. I did not see anything promising so I created a list of parts I think I will need. I am most likely going to change parts as I get more and more into the project but for now this it it. I also went on printables where I found a pelitizer model which gave me an idea for the shredder and why I have a router bit in my BOM. I already have some of the parts but I have ordered all the other parts and they should  come in a a week untill then I am most likly going to work on cad. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjgxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ed4ce9f8c55fe3a3ec5338a7b4899f3430622662/image.png)
  

## 10/17/2025 7 PM - Started Working on CAD Sketch  

I hoped into onshape and started working on the CAD sketch, I took what I drew out and then make a rought sketch after which I had to go to many different product pages to get dimentions of the different items I want to use and dimention that in. This all tool a long time because I wanted to dimention everything as accuratly as I can so its easier for me later down the line. The angle on the side is where I would want to mount the button and stuff, still need to figure out how the shredder will work.

## 10/18/2025 8 AM - Added Items to BOM  

I changed the formatting of the BOM today and added two items that I forgot yeaterday. I ordered the new parts so they should arrive soon as well. The parts I ordered yeaterday should also com ebefore the end of the weekend and that will help me spped up my cad work. I am going to finish the sketch later today. I am not sure if the 775 stepper motor will get the job done but I hope it does, I might have to gear it maybe 5:1 or maybe even more.

## 10/18/2025 10 AM - Shredder CAD  

I started working on the CAD for a shredder, I wanted it to be able to crush down Bambu poop down to a size where it could be run through a pelet extruder. I came accross this model https://www.printables.com/model/738194-micro-plastic-shredder I liked it but it was missing a few things I wanted so I based my model off that one ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5251d4a98b32487f09d0bf2968f338c51d965afe/image.png) I added a mount for a 775 motor and a 5:1 gear ratio to test it. I was also able to get the model sliced and off to my printers to print. I want to make sure the shredder works before working on the CAD for the main frame just incase I need to try something different, you can find the cad on onshape and I will uplooad the step files on Github as well.

## 10/18/2025 2 PM - Main Body CAD  

I had the sketch from earlier that I used to make this main body, I had to change a few things in order for all the parts to fit. I might have to go back and make more changes as I don't have all the parts and dimentions may not be what they advertize in the images 
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzEwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--917dd7568894a09987dff44bbd8b2a39ff5961cb/image.png)

This is what I have so far, I like the overall shape. I had a hard time with some of the component place ments so I just made a masive back place where I can mount the ramps board and other parts

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzExMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8cf2aad3abdf227930821be89e638e7d12a328fb/image.png)

It took a lot of back and forth to get all components to fit in a small form factor.

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzExMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8d7d4f9fffac7ba78559f8c62540721604bc49dd/image.png)

I also started an assembly where I will be adding all the parts as I design them

https://cad.onshape.com/documents/801ecd6329a45d18a34da95f/w/21c4afe4d5408c28a9ff9146/e/d5dffae5cc0ec32277c5b998?renderMode=0&uiState=68f300e243911c5820e42be2
  

## 10/18/2025 5 PM - Shredder Assembly   

I got the shredder prints all cleaned up and put the assembly together and conencted it to a motor driver to test if this would work. It turns! But when I put poop in there it just stalled under the load. So the 5:1 gear ratio is not going to work going any more that that and the project just gets huge so I found and ordered a cheap 20 buck drill from harbor freight lets see if that works. I put in a some work cleaning the gears as I printed them in resin but it was all for nothing :(

## 10/18/2025 8 PM - Extruder CAD  

I just worked on the CAD for the extruder, and I know right now it dose not look like much because I did not add the motor or the heat block or pipe. But when I do the assembly tomorrow I promise it will all make sense. I had to model some plates that would screw in with some M3 double pass spacers, a fan duct to aim the air flow where I want it and then the pellet duct to get the pellets to the screw.

This is the stack of plates
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE3MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0f440278854bed80f40dc3ccf665416f6432ecb6/image.png)

This is for the fan
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--34f8f84256d60b394794619645e53b1538f26dcf/image.png)

And this if for the pellets
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE3NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b688d2a253405bc3bfe6bfb51e3fe28b64954408/image.png)

I had a hard time with all the lofts as it was hard to get all the profiles and faces just right. I also sliced it and started the print. I will assembel everything tomorrow morning.

https://cad.onshape.com/documents/801ecd6329a45d18a34da95f/w/21c4afe4d5408c28a9ff9146/e/d5dffae5cc0ec32277c5b998?renderMode=0&uiState=68f300e243911c5820e42be2



  

## 10/19/2025 10 AM - Extruder Assembly  

This morning I started of my cleaning all the prints but washing and then curing them
![PXL_20251018_174607597.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb7118f3fea73fdf7825f5e2d63163333d1e76ee/PXL_20251018_174607597.jpg)
After that I crimped the stepper motor wiers and screwed in the gearbox
![PXL_20251019_170132590.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQyNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7997046b6d06b0a294ab76f1c64959e4e906e6ec/PXL_20251019_170132590.jpg)

And then I got rest of the parts assembeled and then made a wire harness for the fans and the temp sensor, I soldered one side of it and crimped the other side. Dupont is not easy to crimp :(

I glued the fans on and put everything together. I had to do the crimp a few times as I did not get it right the first time.

Now most of the extruder is = together just need to do some cabel management and then test the heating and motor later today

## 10/19/2025 12 PM - Test Code RAMPS 1.4  

Since I had most of the extruder parts wired up I started writing the code for the arduino mega and the RAMPS 1.4 board. I had to look at a lot of documentation and it took me a while to get all the pin numbers and some context on how to use this board. For right now all the code dose is heat up the extruder to 300 deg C and run the fans but I realized when I plug the 5v fans into the 5v on the ramps it messes with the temp data so I think I am going to have to power them seperatly and have a relay or something similar.

The code also prints out the temp so I can see it while testing. I also tested is the motor spins which it does but I turned it off to test the heating. I am going to add a button and rotary encoder later to control speed and tuff

I also had to de solder a diode on the board in order to power it. This took a really long time as the board is so packed that I didn't want to burn any of the other components around the diode

## 10/19/2025 2 PM - Main Body CAD V2  

Last time I worked on main body CAD I designed it so the shredder would be powered by a 775 motor but since that doesn't work I had to change the CAD to fit a drill motor and gear box. This was very hard to do as I basicaly has to start over and because I don't have the drill I bought yet I had to guess the dimentions so I will probably have to change it again in a few days when I get it. I also added a slot for the power cord and a power switch in the back.

I also have to cut out vent holes for the fan and do some more stuff, but I am taking a break from CAD for a bit

  

## 10/19/2025 7 PM - More CAAAAD  

I know I said I am not doing CAD anymore but I wanted to get some more work done. Here is what I got done. Created the gears for the spooler system, also made the mount which kinda works like the AMS lite mount. Made the fan vent and then resized the shredder part to maybe fit and drill and the shredder, I also made the holes for the stepper motor mount of the extruder and the cover plate for that.

All cad is on onshape for now, I will put it on Git Hub when I get some more work done and it looks better.

## 10/20/2025 5 PM - Some CAD and assembly  

Got a lott of work done today, started the day with printing and cleaning up a print to replace one of the extruder plates that was cracking, the print was 6 mins but then cleaning curing took a while.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzg4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--54a8681972936d73cddf612d1bca5834df88f9ac/image.png)

then in the afternoon I worked on cad I did some of the math to figure out where the pellet pipe would go and then designed the pipe and added that all to the assembly
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzg4NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8f8951859ecf0bc5e8e199ba76ad390ab1743881/image.png)

I also had to clean up some of the files, and then I organized the git hub repo so all the cad files are in order.

Then I assembeled the plates that I printed in the morning onto the extruder, I also had to glue the 2 fans back on. I used like 10x the hot glue I used the first time to make sure it stays stuck this time.

I am very close to start printing all the parts, the drill arrives tomorrow. I am going to take it apart for the motor then I will make the changes in the CAD for the drill and then slice to start the prints.

this is what the final extruder looks as of right now

## 10/20/2025 9 PM - Spooler CAD  

I have been worrying less about the spooler untilll now... I finalized the gear ratio I will be using for the spooler to work with a stepper motor the ratio I am planing on using is 170:30. The really big gear needs to attach to a part that can allow a spool to be slotted in which I designed previously. I was planing on printing a rod on the gear and the sliding it on but the rod would be week due to direction of layer lines so I re-did that to have a sort of slot and I am going to glue it in place now.

This is what the gear looks like

and then the AMS lite coupler

I had to firsly do a lot of research to figure out how large the gear ratio needs to be in order for me to get enough power. But once I got that the rest seemed okay. I have to now add this to the list of things I need to print. Before the 170teeth gear I had done 180 based on rough math but I realized that was too big almost 18cm across. 
  

## 10/21/2025 - Shredder Assembly Test and CAD  

The drill arrived, so I started by taking it all apart for its motor and gearbox system, this is causr my original idea with that 775 and the 5:1 gear ratio did not work. Once I took the drill appart I and to de-solder the motor because I did not want to use that control cuircetry.

After that I attached my router bit to the drill and connected the wiers from a 12v psu and the motor controler. After which I started slowly testing if this could shred stuff which it could. While testing this is what my table looked like

Since this set up was able to do its job, I moved on to the longer part of fixing all the CAD to get everything ready for printing. I made a slot in the back for the motor and gearbox, made the slot in the top for the shredder and cleaned up all the dimentions

The hardest part in all of this was holding the drill down while testing, becuase the motor body would just spining if I didn't hold it down right thats why the slot in the back is cut out spcificaly to hold the motor

## 10/22/2025 - Slpit, SLiced, and Printing  

I stated by cutting the main body cad into parts that could be fit on the build plate of the printers at my school. I also had to see what way to split would affect the least amount of featurs. This is how I split it up
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU1NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e44dab014f4ffd3b8de845d790a592d6f6b77814/image.png)

Then I opened up cura and then one by one sliced up all the parts, this is when I reallized in there default orientation it would take lot of supports and 30h per part, so I started messing with orientation. Once I was happy with all of this the saved all of the files. At this point each print would take 24 hour :( 

Then at school I got the printers set up by trying spools thta had been dryed over night and calibrating the print cores of the ultimaker s5 (there were 2 printers)

Then I started the print and checked to make sure the first layer was coming down okay.

When I went back to check after an hour I realized the nozzel got clogged cause this is what I saw
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU2MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6e8fa6fbfb90a6dded80f9e8d4309b3230bd211f/image.png)

So I used the neddel first then did a few cold pulls to solve this and then started the print again. 

6 hours into the print I realized something about that cad
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU2MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--49670e92d166dfacfb402a50056183df8c3c308c/image.png)
This part the holds the motor in place should have been a seperate part and I should screw it in so I can adjust where it needs to be. 

So the new plan is to let the print finish and then I will just cut the current part out if it doesn't work  and print just the part and then screw it in.

## 10/23/2025 - 2/4 prints done!  

I had stated the prints yesterday and today 2 of them were done (kinda) on of the printers tripped the breaker with only 2 hours left but the other print turned out well.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDkzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f4433a4f45881fa9a73c8b1c2f65cc550bcda8f6/image.png)

So I measure upto the part that worked re sliced only the falied part and then started that print, once that was done I took it off removed a lot of supports. This was probably the hardest part. At one point I had to pour hot water into the part to melt the supports out. Once I got all of that done I sanded all the edges that needed to be glued first with 320 grit to flatten and then with 220 to score it a little for the glue to work. Then I used medium CA glue to stick the 3 parts toether.

I also got the other 2 prints started so I should have them by tomorrow.

  

## 10/24/2025 7 AM - Some more print clean up  

I printed 2 more parts that I am going to need in order to put everything together. I printed these in resin so the clean up and post processing to longer. I had already done the cad so all had to do was slices, and then when the print was done some clean up.

Now I have almost all the parts I need to put everything together

## 10/24/2025 4 PM - 4/4 Prints Done!  

The last 2 of the big parts were done printing, I started by getting them off the build plate and then washing both the build plates with soap and water I had put soo much glue that I had to scrape form of the glue off, then I started removing the supports, these 2 had the hardest supports because of the psu slot it was a really large 90 deg overhang. Once I got all the supports off I spent some time sanding all the surfaces that were going to get glued, I went from 320 to 220 on these parts as well. There was a small defect in the first 2 prints so I had to sand extra hard because other wise the parts didn't line up. ![Screenshot 2025-10-24 161219.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTMxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--bbd7aa428451dc9f6c8f1a85284c3d472b25a4e2/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20161219.png)

This is the final result, I am ready to start placing all the components in. I still need to print a few components but other than that we are making good progress.
