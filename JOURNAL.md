## 10/17/2025 1 PM - Drawing Rought Sketches   

I started brainstroming ideas and sketched out some ideas of how everything can be positioned. I had to think about overall size as I want to keep it kinda small. Next I am going to look of some of the parts and start sketching it in Onshape. I also need to see if a motor can power a mini shreder. I also need to run 2 stepper motors one from extruder and spooler. I am thinking of using the RAMPS 1.4 board. I looked into all the power requierments but I need to find a good power supply![PXL_20251017_203021542.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjc0NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fbde216a4efbf2e1c35edbb74509fa38e3c6f60b/PXL_20251017_203021542.jpg)
  

## 10/17/2025 5 PM - Researched Parts & Created a List  

I did a lot of research looking to see if anyone had already done something like this before or any parts or components I can find. I did not see anything promising so I created a list of parts I think I will need. I am most likely going to change parts as I get more and more into the project but for now this it it. I also went on printables where I found a pelitizer model which gave me an idea for the shredder and why I have a router bit in my BOM. I already have some of the parts but I have ordered all the other parts and they should  come in a a week untill then I am most likly going to work on cad. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjgxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ed4ce9f8c55fe3a3ec5338a7b4899f3430622662/image.png)
  

## 10/17/2025 7 PM - Started Working on CAD Sketch  

I hoped into onshape and started working on the CAD sketch, I took what I drew out and then make a rought sketch after which I had to go to many different product pages to get dimentions of the different items I want to use and dimention that in. This all tool a long time because I wanted to dimention everything as accuratly as I can so its easier for me later down the line. The angle on the side is where I would want to mount the button and stuff, still need to figure out how the shredder will work.

## 10/18/2025 8 AM - Added Items to BOM  

I changed the formatting of the BOM today and added two items that I forgot yeaterday. I ordered the new parts so they should arrive soon as well. The parts I ordered yeaterday should also com ebefore the end of the weekend and that will help me spped up my cad work. I am going to finish the sketch later today. I am not sure if the 775 stepper motor will get the job done but I hope it does, I might have to gear it maybe 5:1 or maybe even more.

## 10/18/2025 10 AM - Shredder CAD  

I started working on the CAD for a shredder, I wanted it to be able to crush down Bambu poop down to a size where it could be run through a pelet extruder. I came accross this model https://www.printables.com/model/738194-micro-plastic-shredder I liked it but it was missing a few things I wanted so I based my model off that one ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5251d4a98b32487f09d0bf2968f338c51d965afe/image.png) I added a mount for a 775 motor and a 5:1 gear ratio to test it. I was also able to get the model sliced and off to my printers to print. I want to make sure the shredder works before working on the CAD for the main frame just incase I need to try something different, you can find the cad on onshape and I will uplooad the step files on Github as well.

## 10/18/2025 2 PM - Main Body CAD  

I had the sketch from earlier that I used to make this main body, I had to change a few things in order for all the parts to fit. I might have to go back and make more changes as I don't have all the parts and dimentions may not be what they advertize in the images 
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzEwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--917dd7568894a09987dff44bbd8b2a39ff5961cb/image.png)

This is what I have so far, I like the overall shape. I had a hard time with some of the component place ments so I just made a masive back place where I can mount the ramps board and other parts

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzExMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8cf2aad3abdf227930821be89e638e7d12a328fb/image.png)

It took a lot of back and forth to get all components to fit in a small form factor.

I also started an assembly where I will be adding all the parts as I design them

## 10/18/2025 5 PM - Shredder Assembly   

I got the shredder prints all cleaned up and put the assembly together and conencted it to a motor driver to test if this would work. It turns! But when I put poop in there it just stalled under the load. So the 5:1 gear ratio is not going to work going any more that that and the project just gets huge so I found and ordered a cheap 20 buck drill from harbor freight lets see if that works. I put in a some work cleaning the gears as I printed them in resin but it was all for nothing :(

## 10/18/2025 8 PM - Extruder CAD  

I just worked on the CAD for the extruder, and I know right now it dose not look like much because I did not add the motor or the heat block or pipe. But when I do the assembly tomorrow I promise it will all make sense. I had to model some plates that would screw in with some M3 double pass spacers, a fan duct to aim the air flow where I want it and then the pellet duct to get the pellets to the screw.

This is the stack of plates

This is for the fan
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--34f8f84256d60b394794619645e53b1538f26dcf/image.png)

And this if for the pellets
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE3NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b688d2a253405bc3bfe6bfb51e3fe28b64954408/image.png)

I had a hard time with all the lofts as it was hard to get all the profiles and faces just right. I also sliced it and started the print. I will assembel everything tomorrow morning.

https://cad.onshape.com/documents/801ecd6329a45d18a34da95f/w/21c4afe4d5408c28a9ff9146/e/d5dffae5cc0ec32277c5b998?renderMode=0&uiState=68f300e243911c5820e42be2



  

## 10/19/2025 - Extruder Assembly  

This morning I started of my cleaning all the prints but washing and then curing them
![PXL_20251018_174607597.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb7118f3fea73fdf7825f5e2d63163333d1e76ee/PXL_20251018_174607597.jpg)
After that I crimped the stepper motor wiers and screwed in the gearbox
![PXL_20251019_170132590.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQyNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7997046b6d06b0a294ab76f1c64959e4e906e6ec/PXL_20251019_170132590.jpg)

And then I got rest of the parts assembeled and then made a wire harness for the fans and the temp sensor, I soldered one side of it and crimped the other side. Dupont is not easy to crimp :(

I glued the fans on and put everything together. I had to do the crimp a few times as I did not get it right the first time.

Now most of the extruder is = together just need to do some cabel management and then test the heating and motor later today
